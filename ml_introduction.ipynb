    "#### Machine Learning\n",
    "Machine Learning is a class of algorithms which are data-driven. unlike classical algorithms, it is the data that defines a good answer and Not the human.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "A Non-machine learning algorithm might define a face as having a roundish structure, two eyes,hair, nose, etc. The algorithm then looks for these `hard-coded` features in test cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A machine learning algorithm might only be given several pictures of faces and non-faces that are labeled as such. From the examples (called the training set) it would \"figure out\" it's own definition of a face."
